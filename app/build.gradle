    //jackson-databind - This is known as the artifact id. It is the specific library we need from the com.fasterxml.jackson.core group.
    //2+ - This is the version of the jackson-databind library we want. The + says that we'll take anything that's at or above version 2, but below version 3. This means that 2.1.3 is fine, but versions such as 1.9.0 or 3.8.2 are not.
